# FriendFinder

## Description

This app is hosted on heroku and is a quiz that matches the users compatibility with characters from the Friends TV show. The user gives their name and a link to their photo, which are required. They then answer ten simple questions about their personality and a modal alerts them with the results.

## Problem

Create an app that has a front and backend and is hosted on Heroku.

## Solution

- Create a landing page
- Create a survey form with ten questions
- Have a fixed data file of possible matches
- Take the users input data and compare it to each possible match to find the closest one
- Return the result to the user
